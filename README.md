# RxJS exercises

This application contains unit tests. These tests are currently failing. 
The services need to be fixed - do not modify the unit tests.

The tests are organized with incremental difficulty, 
simply 'fdescribe' the test for the service that you want to work on:

* Level 0: `level0.service.ts`: basic creation and subscription
* Level 1: `level1.service.ts`: first operators
* Level 2: `level2.service.ts`: simple combination of observables
* Level 3: `level3.service.ts`: combination of values from observables
* Level 6: `level6.service.ts`: typeahead (combination of observables with constraints)
* Level 7: `level7.service.ts`: conditional execution

There is a challenge below `todo/services/*`
  * Fix `todo.service`
  * Fix `user.service`
  * Fix `dashboard.service`

Hint: The first two of those are easy, the dashboard is challenging 
(and is not meant at all for developers who are new to RxJS).

However, the dashboard exercise doesn't have to be completed in
one go: there are multiple steps and different implementation
paths that you can follow. If you want more guidance, then
check [Guidance.md](./Guidance.md).

# Origin:

Originally from Philip Schm√∂kel, 2017-2019

* updated angular cli
* removed unnecessary code
* some fixes and documentation improvements
* provided sample solution
* provided Guidance.md
* updated test suite to have multiple progressing test cases 
* added alternative sample solutions

# META: Please note when improving this exercise

## Branch master

* The test cases of the master branch fail (obviously) as intended

## Branch samplesolution

* the DashboardService.getTodosWithUsers() should use an implementation that is "nice"
* The test case (DashboardService.spec.ts) actually tests not only the one method getTodosWithUsers() but the other solution variations as well.
  It includes a configuration of which methods to call and which test cases to ignore.
  * If you add a new implementation variant, please add it to the `const testImplementations = ...`
